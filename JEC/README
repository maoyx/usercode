####This is what I have been modified and used for JEC determination####
1.   cmsrel CMSSWVERSION
   cd CMSSWVERSION/src
   cmsenv
   cvs co      JetMETAnalysis/JetAnalyzers
   cvs co      JetMETAnalysis/JetUtilities
   cvs co      UserCode/YaxianMao/JEC

2. replace the following code under JetMETAnalysis/JetAnalyzers/bin with Yaxian/JEC/bin/:
jet_response_analyzer_x.cc
jet_l3_correction_x.cc
jet_l2_correction_x.cc
jet_draw_corrections_x.cc

3. run the script under Yaxian/JEC/scripts/MCpp276HITracking.sh to merge the pthat bin samples (change the path and name accordingly)
./MCpp276HITrack.sh

4. run the script under Yaxian/JEC/scripts/runJECpp276HITrack.sh to determine the JEC and generate the *.txt files
./runJECpp276HITrack.sh

5. run the script under Yaxian/JEC/script/corr_MCpp276HITracking.sh to test the JEC correction factors with *.txt on-the-fly
./corr_MCpp276HITracking.sh

6. run the macros under Yaxian/JEC/macros/JetResponseMacro_Pt.C and JetResponseMacro_Eta.C to check the JEC closure for both JES and JER and save plots
root -l
.L *.C
.x *.C
 
7. Once everything is checked, copy *.txt files to CondFormats/JetMETObjects/data/

8. convert *.txt file into db, using CondFormats/JetMETObjects/JetCorrectionDBWriter_cfg.py by running (used the one under Yaxian/JEC/bin)
cmsRun JetCorrectionDBWriter_cfg.py

9. check the names of payloads in the db file is correct, by running
cmscond_list_iov -c sqlite_file:JEC_PA5TEV_CMSSW538_2013.db -a

Note: every time changed something in the package for l2 and l3 correction *.cc, need a recompile by running
scramv1 b


###### After a new production with JEC db file produced, one can run full closure following below:
1. ./runPythiaHydjet.sh

2 Using the output from 1 and make drawing using *.C under YaxianMAO/JEC/macros/closure

root -l -b -q JetEnergyResolution.C gives the JES/JER distribution vs Gen jet pt
root -l -b -q Pt_JetEnergyResolutionEta.C gives the JES/JER distribution vs Gen jet eta
root -l -b -q HFbin_OneJetAlgoJER.C gives the JES/JER for different HF bin closure vs Gen jet pt for one jet algorithm
